Please BYO-ice if you anticipate needing ice. We always have a fully stocked first aid kit and AED at Squatch HQ. Our first aid kit includes menstrual products and wipes. We also provide private changing tents that are available for use before, during, and after our races. Lastly, we have The Jackalope Tent! This is a quiet space that is available at most of our Trail Parties. The tent is away from the crowds and loud music. Stop by the Jackalope Tent when you need a break. The Jackalope Tent is a multi-use space that is also available for breastfeeding. Why do we call it the Jackalope Tent? Jackalopes are peaceful cryptids and are also excellent singers (usually tenor). "},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-74.291615424881826,40.755701744826879]}}]}
